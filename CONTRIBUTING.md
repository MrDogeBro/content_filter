## Your First Contribution

Unsure of where to start contributing to Content Filter? A good place to start would be working on a simple issue that or feature that nobody is assigned to yet. If you are new to contributing, it would be good to take a look at something like [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) for some guidance.

## Getting Started

If you are making a change that is a one or two line fix, please just open a issue with the one or two lines you would like to change. If you would like to change something bigger than one or to lines, please follow the instructions below.

1. Create your own fork of the repository.
1. Make all your changes in your fork. Please be sure to make sure your code meets our expectations.
1. Submit a pull request with information on your changes and have it linked to your fork.

Small changes can be added by opening an issue with the proposed change. Below are some examples of these types of small changes.

- Spelling / grammar fixes
- Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
- Comment clean up
- Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
- Adding logging messages or debugging output
- Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
- Moving source files from one directory or package to another

## Reporting a Bug

To report a bug, please create a issue. When creating a issue, make sure to answer these six questions:

1. What version of python are you using?
1. What version of Content Filter are you using?
1. What operating system are you using?
1. What did you do?
1. What did you expect to see?
1. What did you see instead?

## Suggesting a Feature or Enhancement

To suggest a feature or enhancement, please use the discussions tab. Here, you can submit your idea for everyone to discuss and give their thoughts on. Make sure to be very clear with your suggestion so that others can understand what your idea is.

## Code Review Process

I try to look at pull requests every week or two. When I review your pull request, I will leave any changes or feedback on the pull request. Once the pull request meets the requirements and I am happy with the change, it will be merged into the code base. After feedback has been given a response is expected within two weeks. If it has been more than two weeks without any activity from the pull request author, the pull request may be closed.
