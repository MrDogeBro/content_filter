# Python Content Filter
A basic but robust content filter for python. Content Filter allows you to easily detect if a piece of text 
contains any language it shouldn't. It also allows you to add your own words to filter for, remove words to filter for, 
or define a whole new list of words to filter for.

## Installation
To install Content Filter, enter the following command in a terminal window.
```$ pip install content-filter```
